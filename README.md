Fork from `very_good_cli` with extra features for Avila Tek ‚õ∞Ô∏è Mobile projects.


## Special features in `atmos_cli`

To this date, `atmos_cli` is almost identical to `very_good_cli`, but with the following extra features:

The only command that is modified from the original CLI tool is `atmos create flutter_app`.

First, it uses [atmos_core](https://github.com/andrespd99/atmos_templates/tree/main/atmos_core) template, a slightly different template from [very_good_core](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_templates/tree/main/very_good_core).

Second, it has an extended setup process that does the following things:
- Sets up FVM with the newest stable Flutter version.
- Runs `mason get` and generates the base bricks used in our projects: [`avilatek_readme`](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/avilatek_readme/0.1.0), [`avila_codemagic`](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/avila_codemagic/0.1.0), [`bootstrap_go_routes`](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/bootstrap_go_routes/0.1.1) and [`avila_themes`](https://brickhub.dev/bricks/avila_themes/0.1.0).
- Prompts the user to setup Firebase in the project. **This is the neatest feature in `atmos`!**. It will setup Firebase for all flavors (development, staging and production) for iOS and Android platforms. It also sets up the firebase config files in Dart, Android and iOS. In iOS, a config folder is created with every `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and adds a Build Phase script to use the correct file for each flavor. In Dart, it creates a `firebase_config.dart` file with the correct configuration for each flavor. This is a huge time saver for developers!
- Finally, adds needed dependencies and fixes dart analysis issues.
