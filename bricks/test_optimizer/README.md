A brick that generates a single entrypoint for Dart tests.

_Generated by [mason][1] 🧱_

## Getting Started 🚀

```sh
mason make test_optimizer --package-root ./path/to/package --on-conflict overwrite
```

The above command will generate a `.test_optimizer.dart` in the `test` directory that imports and executes all tests

```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND
// Consider adding this file to your .gitignore.

import 'app/view/app_test.dart' as app_view_app_test_dart;
import 'counter/cubit/counter_cubit_test.dart' as counter_cubit_counter_cubit_test_dart;
import 'counter/view/counter_page_test.dart' as counter_view_counter_page_test_dart;

void main() {
  app_view_app_test_dart.main();
  counter_cubit_counter_cubit_test_dart.main();
  counter_view_counter_page_test_dart.main();
}
```
